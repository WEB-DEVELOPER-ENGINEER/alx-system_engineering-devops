**Incident Report: 504 Error / Site Outage**

**Summary:**
On September 11th, 2018, at midnight (PST), a server access disruption led to a widespread 504 error, impacting website access. The server in question was built upon a LAMP stack architecture.

**Timeline:**
- 00:00 PST: Users encountered 504 errors while attempting to access the website.
- 00:05 PST: Verified operational status of Apache and MySQL services.
- 00:10 PST: Initial inspection showed the server and database were functioning correctly; website loading issue persisted.
- 00:12 PST: Resolved by restarting Apache; server status and curl test indicated a successful response (200 OK).
- 00:18 PST: Investigated Apache error logs for insights.
- 00:25 PST: Observed unexpected shutdown of Apache in /var/log; PHP error logs were conspicuously absent.
- 00:30 PST: Uncovered disabled error logging in php.ini; rectified configuration to enable error logging.
- 00:32 PST: Apache restart followed by parsing of PHP error logs.
- 00:36 PST: PHP error logs unveiled a filename typo within wp-settings.php causing incorrect loading and Apache shutdown.
- 00:38 PST: Rectified typo, restarted Apache.
- 00:40 PST: Server resumed normal operation; website accessed without issues.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The incident's root cause lay in an incorrect file reference within the wp-settings.php file, which triggered a 500 error upon server curl. Initial investigation revealed the absence of PHP error logs, hampering precise diagnosis. With enabled error logging, Apache restart was performed for detailed error analysis. Discovered PHP logs exposed a misspelled .phpp file extension within wp-settings.php. This typo caused the site access issue. Given the possibility of similar misconfigurations on other servers, an automated solution was sought. A Puppet code deployment rectified file extension errors across all servers, swiftly resolving the problem and normalizing site accessibility.

**Corrective and Preventive Measures:**
1. **Uniform Error Logging:** Standardize error logging across all servers and websites to streamline troubleshooting.
2. **Local Testing:** Mandate thorough local testing of servers and websites prior to deployment in multi-server environments. This proactive measure minimizes downtime risks and expedites issue rectification.
3. **Configuration Audits:** Periodically audit server configurations and settings to identify potential inconsistencies or misconfigurations.
4. **Automated Validation:** Develop automated scripts or tests to verify critical components' functionality and adherence to expected behavior.
5. **Centralized Monitoring:** Implement centralized monitoring to promptly detect anomalies and preemptively address potential issues.
6. **Documentation Enhancement:** Maintain up-to-date documentation detailing system architectures, configurations, and incident resolution procedures.
7. **Training and Knowledge Sharing:** Organize training sessions to educate team members on best practices, error diagnosis, and debugging techniques.
8. **Continuous Improvement:** Establish a feedback loop to continuously refine incident response and resolution processes.

**Tasks:**
1. **Error Logging Review:** Review and update error logging configurations across all servers and websites.
2. **Test Automation Implementation:** Develop automated tests for local validation before deployment.
3. **Configuration Audit Plan:** Schedule periodic audits of server configurations to identify inconsistencies.
4. **Centralized Monitoring Setup:** Implement centralized monitoring tools for real-time anomaly detection.
5. **Documentation Revision:** Enhance documentation to include incident-specific troubleshooting procedures.
6. **Training Program:** Organize training sessions on effective debugging techniques and error analysis.
7. **Process Refinement:** Establish a regular review process for incident response to incorporate lessons learned.

By adopting these measures, the organization aims to enhance system resilience, reduce downtime, and fortify incident response capabilities.
